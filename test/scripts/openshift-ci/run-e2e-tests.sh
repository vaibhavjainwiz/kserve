# This is a helper script to run E2E tests on the openshift-ci operator.
# This script assumes to be run inside a container/machine that has
# python pre-installed and the `oc` command available. Additional tooling,
# like kustomize and the mc client are installed by the script if not available.
# The oc CLI is assumed to be configured with the credentials of the
# target cluster. The target cluster is assumed to be a clean cluster.
